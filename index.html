      <h2>Fearless First: Negotiating the Hidden Curriculum in Higher Education and Other Societal Institutions</h2>
      <p>This course examines the research and theory about first-generation college students 
        and complicates the discourse around identity and experiences as a first-generation college 
        student and the efforts made to expand access to higher education and major U. S. institutions. 
        Moreover, the course will encourage students to use their strengths and cultural wealth, assets and values, 
        along with introducing and expanding known cultural and social capital to successfully negotiate these institutional 
        environments. Students who identify as first-generation are strongly encouraged to enroll.</p>

      <h2>About GPT, including ChatGPT</h2>
      <p><strong>Architecture</strong>: GPT, including ChatGPT, is based on the transformer architecture, which has been
        a breakthrough in deep learning and natural language processing. The architecture allows for effective modeling
        of long-term dependencies in text.</p>

      <p><strong>Training</strong>: The model is trained in two main phases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pre-training</strong>: It's trained on vast amounts of text from the internet to predict the next
          word in a sequence. This helps it learn grammar, facts about the world, and even some reasoning abilities.
          However, it can also pick up biases from the data.</li>
        <li><strong>Fine-tuning</strong>: After pre-training, the model is then fine-tuned on narrower datasets,
          sometimes generated with human reviewers following specific guidelines. This helps in narrowing down the
          model's behavior for specific tasks.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Capabilities</strong>: ChatGPT is designed to generate human-like text based on the input it receives.
        It can answer questions, write essays, create poetry, generate ideas, tutor in a range of subjects, and much
        more.</p>

      <p><strong>Limitations</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It can produce incorrect or misleading information.</li>
        <li>It might be overly verbose or tend to "overuse" certain phrases.</li>
        <li>It's sensitive to input phrasing and might give different answers based on slight rephrasings.</li>
        <li>It might sometimes respond to harmful instructions or exhibit biases, although efforts are made to curtail
          these behaviors.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Versions</strong>: OpenAI has released several versions of the GPT series over the years, with each new
        version generally being larger and more capable than the last. For example, GPT-3, released in 2020, is one of
        the most well-known versions, boasting 175 billion parameters.</p>

      <p><strong>Applications</strong>: Beyond mere chatting, models like ChatGPT find applications in diverse areas
        such as content creation, coding help, tutoring, and more.</p>

      <p>OpenAI, the organization behind GPT, continues to research and improve upon the model's capabilities and safety
        features, and they often seek feedback from the user community to make it better.</p>
